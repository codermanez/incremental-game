# Things I don't know how to fix
Buy Amount not
# Update 1
For the current moment, to save and load, call WriteToStorage(gameData, "chronostasis-save"), and ReadFromStorage("chronostasis-save").<br>
Why? Because I am too lazy to fix that right now, however it will be fixed in the next update.
# Update 2
## In-Game
Included a tab switcher from the "Time" menu to the "Menu" menu, where you can find saving and loading, as well as import/export.<br>
Made good use of that multiplier, current formula is ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75057913/147836998-12090c91-a3ed-41cf-978f-d94e9734fb6f.png), where x is equal to the number of tier bought.<br>
Made code more efficient, to run the game faster
## Extra
Organized into folders.<br>
Elements now grouped and rendered in separate scripts, to add code readability.
